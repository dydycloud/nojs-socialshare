#Why?

Because you can achieve 80% of the functionality you require to share on social networks without needing to download, parse or care about JavaScript

#How?

All major networks have a URL you can pass stuff to, that is what we have used in the example. Just make sure that everything you pass as a string is URLencoded.

#The design looks rubbish.

Yeah, I am not a designer but you can target them using classes and style as you see fit.

#Real world example?
